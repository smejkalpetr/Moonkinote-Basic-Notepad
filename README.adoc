# Moonkinote - Basic Notepad

This is the first project I have ever done - 6/2019. The code is not very
clean or nice at all, but I thought I would still publish this project here.

The point was to create a program that would use modules instead of all source
code being in one file as well as stuff like polymorphism, I/O streams and files,
Makefile, documentation generation, etc.


### Original description:

===========================|| MOONKINOTE ||===========================
| DESCRIPTION: Moonkinote is a system for keeping notes. This small  |
| program offers creating notes of variable categories, exporting    |
| and imprting notes in a few formats, built-in text editor and more.|
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| INSTALLATION: You can install and run Moonkinote with Makefile.    |
| -> to compile program do 'make compile'                            |
| -> after compiling, you can run the program by 'make run'          |
| -> command 'make doc' generates documentation and saves it in /doc |
| -> by using just 'make' or 'make all' both doc and compile will    |
|    be done                                                         |
| -> in case you want to get back where you started, run command     |
|    'make clean'. This will delete the /doc folder as well as all   |
|    object files.                                                   |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM - all this and much more you can find after |
|                          launching the program and seeing help.    |

Looking back, I see I got much better overall, especially at designing classes and organizing program structure (like using design patterns,
good practices, etc.). Also the naming is not always perfect and some problems are solved in an unnecessary difficult way.

As I have already said, this was my first project so it is expected not to be good (being actually far from good, hehe).
