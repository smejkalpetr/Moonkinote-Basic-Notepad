This is the first project I have ever done - 6/2019. The code is not very
clean or nice at all, but I thought I would still include this project here.

The point was to create a program that would use modules instead of all source
code being in one file as well as stuff like polymorphism, working with files,
generate documentation, etc.


Original description:

===========================|| MOONKINOTE ||===========================
| DESCRIPTION: Moonkinote is a system for keeping notes. This small  |
| program offers creating notes of variable categories, exporting    |
| and imprting notes in a few formats, built-in text editor and more.|
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| INSTALLATION: You can install and run Moonkinote with Makefile.    |
| -> to compile program do 'make compile'                            |
| -> after compiling, you can run the program by 'make run'          |
| -> command 'make doc' generates documentation and saves it in /doc |
| -> by using just 'make' or 'make all' both doc and compile will    |
|    be done                                                         |
| -> in case you want to get back where you started, run command     |
|    'make clean'. This will delete the /doc folder as well as all   |
|    object files.                                                   |
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM - all this and much more you can find after |
|                          launching the program and seeing help.    |
